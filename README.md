# Breast Cancer Detection - ML Models Comparison

This project evaluates multiple machine learning algorithms on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

## Models Used
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- Support Vector Machine  
- Artificial Neural Network

Each model was trained and tested, and their accuracy scores were compared to determine the most effective algorithm for this task.

## Dataset
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset)

## Goal
Identify which ML model provides the highest accuracy for breast cancer detection.

## Results
The model performances are printed and visualized for easy comparison.
